# BarbarousKing_DDNames

This File is an export of the current Viewers on Barbarousking's stream.

In order to use it in Darkest Dungeon you just need to do 3 Steps:

1: Download the File names.string_table.xml in this Repo.

2: Replace the File in the Game Folder under the Following Path

```http
  SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DarkestDungeon\localization\
```

Run the localization.exe under

```http
  SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DarkestDungeon\_windows\
```

There you go you now have the Viewer Names appear as the characters in game.

Cheers
